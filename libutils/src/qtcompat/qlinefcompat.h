\namespace QtCompat
\brief Reunites in form of utility functions and constants all code that is not compatible between major Qt versions.
The main purpose of this approach is to make pgModeler backward compatible to Qt 5.15, 5.14, 5.13 and so on (restricted to Qt 5.9) without major problems.
\note This namespace will be discarded when pgModeler have its code ported to Qt 6.
